        <h2> NodeJS </h2>
        <p>Node.JS is a free, open-source runtime environment for JavaScript. It is one of the most popular tools that allow developers to create web applications.</p>
<p>Check to see if you have Node.JS by typing in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-bash">node -v
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not have it, you can install it online.</p>
<p>Node.JS is powerful, however utilizing its full potential requires a lot of work. Instead, we can use open-source frameworks and packages with Node Package Manager, or NPM.</p>
<p>To see if we have it installed, type into your terminal:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-bash">npm -v
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not have it, then type in:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-bash">npm install -g npm
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, frameworks are extremely useful. In fact, this website is running off of a Node.JS server using the Eleventy framework, along with a handful of integrated modules.</p>
